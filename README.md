# example-vite-react

An example of a Reflame React app with Vite.

Using Reflame and Vite together in the same codebase this way allows you to try out Reflame on a Vite project with 0 risk (but [with](https://github.com/reflame/example-vite-react/pull/2/commits/5e917fc377dad6e82051438ae406f5dabdae6315) [some](https://github.com/reflame/example-vite-react/pull/2/commits/d2a0fba58f1e995644bfc8106fc50f00e403ba3d) [limitations](https://github.com/reflame/example-vite-react/pull/2/commits/e12bf50d60da05b59665f56f14225da00a8650ed) compared to using Vite or Reflame alone). 

Continue to deploy previews and production using Vite with an existing deployment service you're familiar with, while enjoying Reflame's instant previews. Only switch over production deployments once Reflame has earned your trust for instant production deploys as well.

Even after you've fully migrated to Reflame, you can continue to use Vite as an offline-capable backup to the [Reflame VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=reflame.agent). The extension deploys to the internet on every save using Live Previews, which requires internet access. In exchange, it also enables seamless cross-device sharing, and full production parity on every save.
